Dual Franka
===========

RPent can control a two-node dual-Franka setup through an RLinf
``RealWorldEnv`` worker.

Install
-------

.. note::

	The following guide installs only the Python side (the custom RLinf
	Franka branch and ``rlinf-openpi``); it does **not** build the robot-node
	control stack the two arms need. Before installing RPent, follow the RLinf
	dual-Franka guide to set up both robot nodes: choose a compatible
	``LIBFRANKA_VERSION``, build the ``franka-franky`` (franky/libfranka) control
	stack, configure the PREEMPT_RT real-time kernel and permissions, and install
	the GELLO teleoperation and gripper dependencies. See the `RLinf dual-Franka
	guide
	<https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/examples/embodied/dual_franka.html>`_.

From the RPent repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

	uv sync --extra franka

This installs the custom RLinf Franka branch and ``rlinf-openpi`` into
``.venv``.

Calibration
-----------

Hand-eye calibration is performed with ROS
`easy_handeye <https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/easy_handeye>`_. It produces one YAML
per projection camera (``base_camera`` and ``d455_camera``) and saves them under
``~/.ros/easy_handeye/`` by default.

RPent reads a JSON bundle (``hand_eye_calibration.json``) that carries each
camera's ``source_name``, ``parameters``, and ``transformation``. Generate it by
copying those fields out of each ``easy_handeye`` YAML.

The bundle location is configurable with ``--calibration-path`` (default
``~/.ros/easy_handeye/hand_eye_calibration.json``).

Development configuration
-------------------------

Review and edit the checked-in development defaults before enabling motion:

* ``robots/dual_franka/config/example.yaml`` contains the machine identity (both
	robot IPs, camera serials/types, gripper connections), workspace geometry
	(target poses and safety limits), and perception localization bounds +
	base-frame transform.

RPent translates this robot-focused schema into the internal two-node RLinf
cluster and environment objects. To use a different file, pass
``--robot-config /path/to/robot_config.yaml``.

Start the two-node Ray cluster
------------------------------

The two nodes have fixed, different roles (defined in
``robots/dual_franka/runtime_config.py``):

* Node ``0`` is the Ray head: it runs the dual-Franka environment
	worker (all cameras, perception, and arm/gripper state), and the **left**
	arm's real-time controller. For the VLA task, the
	local VLA server also runs here.
* Node ``1`` is a Ray worker: it runs only the **right** arm's real-time
	controller, with no cameras and no RPent process.

Set ``RLINF_NODE_RANK`` before starting Ray on each controller node.

Node ``0``:

.. code-block:: bash

	export RLINF_NODE_RANK=0
	ray stop --force
	ray start --head --port=6379 --node-ip-address=HEAD_IP

Node ``1``:

.. code-block:: bash

	export RLINF_NODE_RANK=1
	ray stop --force
	ray start --address=HEAD_IP:6379 --node-ip-address=WORKER_IP

Run a smoke test
----------------

Task ``0`` tests conservative single-arm analytic motion and gripper primitives:

.. code-block:: bash

	uv run --extra franka rpent --robot dual_franka --task-id 0 \
	  --planner claude_code --model claude-opus-4-8 \
	  --robot-config robots/dual_franka/config/example.yaml \
	  --calibration-path ~/.ros/easy_handeye/hand_eye_calibration.json

RPent starts ``robots/dual_franka/env_server.py`` with the current interpreter,
loads the RPent robot config, generates the internal RLinf adapter config,
connects to Ray, waits for ``healthz``, and records the initial state as step
``0``. Task ``0`` does not load the VLA.

VLA grasp demo
--------------

RPent provides a demo that uses a VLA to grasp objects. Task ``1`` exposes
``vla_grasp`` and can start the dual-Franka VLA server locally.
``PI05_CHECKPOINT_PATH`` points to the trained Pi-05 checkpoint, while
``DUAL_FRANKA_REPO_ID`` is the dataset ID used to locate matching normalization
statistics:

.. code-block:: bash

	export PI05_CHECKPOINT_PATH=/path/to/checkpoints/global_step_N
	export DUAL_FRANKA_REPO_ID=org/dual-franka-tcp-rot6d

	uv run --extra franka rpent --robot dual_franka --task-id 1 \
	  --cuda-device 0 \
	  --planner claude_code --model claude-opus-4-8 \
	  --robot-config robots/dual_franka/config/example.yaml \
	  --calibration-path ~/.ros/easy_handeye/hand_eye_calibration.json

The checkpoint must contain:

.. code-block:: text

	actor/model_state_dict/full_weights.pt
	<DUAL_FRANKA_REPO_ID>/norm_stats.json

**Pretrained checkpoint**

A ready-made task ``1`` checkpoint is published on ModelScope:
`Brunchlife/pi05-dualfranka-tcp-rot6d-clean-desk-532-delect-76000
<https://modelscope.cn/models/Brunchlife/pi05-dualfranka-tcp-rot6d-clean-desk-532-delect-76000>`_.
Download it, point ``PI05_CHECKPOINT_PATH`` at the downloaded directory, and set
``DUAL_FRANKA_REPO_ID`` to the subdirectory that holds ``norm_stats.json``:

.. code-block:: bash

	modelscope download \
	  --model Brunchlife/pi05-dualfranka-tcp-rot6d-clean-desk-532-delect-76000 \
	  --local_dir /path/to/pi05-dualfranka-clean-desk

	export PI05_CHECKPOINT_PATH=/path/to/pi05-dualfranka-clean-desk

.. warning::

	This checkpoint is trained only on our in-house test environment (robot
	poses, cameras, workspace layout, and objects), so it is expected to
	generalize poorly to a different setup. To deploy on your own rig, collect
	demonstrations and fine-tune your own checkpoint with RLinf by following the
	`RLinf dual-Franka guide
	<https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/examples/embodied/dual_franka.html>`_
	(collect GELLO demos, convert to tcp_rot6d, run SFT, then deploy).

When ``--vla-endpoint`` is absent, RPent starts
``robots/dual_franka/vla_server.py`` and loads
``pi05_dualfranka_tcp_rot6d`` once.

To run the VLA service separately:

.. code-block:: bash

	uv run --extra franka python -m robots.dual_franka.vla_server \
	  --model-path /path/to/checkpoints/global_step_N \
	  --repo-id org/dual-franka-tcp-rot6d \
	  --cuda-device 0 --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6000

Then pass ``--vla-endpoint http://VLA_HOST:6000`` to ``rpent``. An external
endpoint always takes precedence over local auto-start.

External environment server
---------------------------

To attach RPent to an already-running dual-Franka environment service:

.. code-block:: bash

	uv run --extra franka rpent --robot dual_franka --task-id 0 \
	  --env-endpoint http://ROBOT_HOST:PORT \
	  --planner claude_code --model claude-opus-4-8 \
	  --robot-config robots/dual_franka/config/example.yaml \
	  --calibration-path ~/.ros/easy_handeye/hand_eye_calibration.json

Tools and artifacts
-------------------

The extension exposes ``view_env_state``, ``view_camera_meta``, ``move_delta``,
``rotate_delta``, ``open_gripper``, ``close_gripper``, and ``vla_grasp``. Each
analytic motion selects exactly one arm, ``left`` or ``right``. Mutating tools
capture per-arm state and synchronized left-wrist, base, and right-wrist images
in RPent's central ``EnvState``.

Safety
------

Keep operators at both emergency stops. Validate task ``0`` with very small
single-arm motions before attempting a grasp. Stop when camera/state results
disagree, when the requested motion is not reached, or when any calibration is
uncertain.

Attended exploration
--------------------

``dual_franka --explore`` supports the operator workflow from PR #176. It reuses
RPent's exploration sessions and layered memory while retaining the existing
real-robot RGB/depth/state logs. This does not enable single-arm ``franka``
exploration.

.. code-block:: bash

   rpent --robot dual_franka --task-id 0 --explore --interactive \
     --robot-config /path/to/robot.yaml \
     --calibration-path /path/to/hand_eye_calibration.json \
     --memory-dir /path/to/memory/dual_franka \
     --explore-attempts-per-session 3 --explore-sessions 2 \
     --output-dir /path/to/new-run

Configure the planner and task-1 VLA as described above. The client skips its
usual reset-on-connect during exploration; underlying hardware initialization
still follows RLinf's own lifecycle. Every session must call
``request_scene_reset`` before motion. The operator restores the physical scene
and replies ``done``; only a successful robot reset with camera/state capture
starts an attempt. Reset failures keep motion blocked.

``request_operator_verdict`` records a fresh observation and asks for
``success``, ``failure``, ``continue`` or ``abort``, with optional notes.
``solved()`` uses the current operator verdict. Motion and ``continue`` clear
previous verdicts. Abort/EOF permits ending without spending the remaining
attempt budget.

With ``--interactive``, reply using ``/operator <request-id> <answer>`` as shown
in the terminal; other lines remain planner steering. Without it, answer the
terminal prompt directly. A TTY is required. Dashboard operator feedback is not
implemented, so Dashboard exploration is rejected before runtime startup.

Each ``sessions/session_<NNN>/`` retains the existing artifacts plus per-step
``exploration.json`` and session-level ``operator_events.json``. Failed attempts
remain in the trace. Memory reads use ``suite`` and ``global``; working notes go
into the task inbox's ``wip/``. After success, draft suite/global lessons in the
inbox; the runner exports the winning attempt's command sequence and adds
operator evidence to its task audit. Recorded coordinates are not automatically
replayed. ``--auto-merge-memory`` is opt-in and invokes the existing memory
merge/index workflow only on successful, error-free exploration runs, including
the ``task_only`` audit/recipe pair.

Prompts are selected by ``robots/dual_franka/prompt_bundle.py``. Evaluation uses
``prompts/system.py`` and ``prompts/user.py``; exploration uses
``prompts/explore.py``. ``tasks.py`` owns task instructions, success criteria and
constraints; ``robot_spec.py`` supplies the rendering variables. Continuation
system prompts retain the task context. The original LIBERO exploration prompt
lives in ``robots/libero/prompts/explore.py``; its simulator reset/termination
assumptions are not inherited by the real robot.

External ``--env-endpoint`` servers must also be updated and advertise
``explicit_reset_only=True``; older servers are rejected before client reset.
Offline tests use fake hardware. Physical reset convergence, camera freshness
and task judgment still require validation on the deployed robot.
